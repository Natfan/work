introduction (1page)
- [ ] scope (boundaries, input/output
- [ ] a convincing/real client
- [ ] complex enough
- [ ] disclaimer (needs signature)

analysis (1 page)
- [ ] outline & approach
- [ ] use case diagram based on the interview (uml2.0)
- [ ] all diagrams should be mock ups
- [ ] priorities (must, like, possible)
- [ ] iops chart
- [ ] signature

smart objectives
- [ ] 1, 2, 3 (??)
- [ ] signature

design
- [ ] test strategy (page of waffle about where you will get the data from etc)
- [ ] test plan (each test refers back to 1 or more smart objectives)
- [ ] tests are designed to test specific use cases. each use case has multiple tests. if x tests are passed then the smart objective is valid
- [ ] entity relationship diagram that uses sample data
- [ ] make a flow chart per use case (subroutine)
- [ ] class diagram (uml 2.0)

implementation
- [ ] source code that should be found in apendix.

testing
- [ ] reshow test plan with a added evidence and pass/fail columns.
- [ ] if tests fail explain why they failed and retest, resulting in many iterations of tests with fixes

evaluation
- [ ] meeting with client.
- [ ] evidence of testing.
- [ ] explain why tests passed or failed.
- [ ] evaluate project based on smart objectives
- [ ] take the possible targets and add them as possible extentions, these do not have to be implemented
  - [ ] these need to be talked about their cost, chance of success etc

apendix
- [ ] interview with client transcript
- [ ] feedback from smart objective
- [ ] sample data from design test cases
- [ ] annotated source code in apendix
