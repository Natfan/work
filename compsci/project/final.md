# Computer Science Project
*By Nathan Windisch*

## Introduction
### Scope
The issue is that there are not many choose-your-adventure video games on the market right now. My client is Oliver Eastgreen Cox and he has requested that I work with him to develop an application which will enable the user to play through predetermined stories, along with an audiobook being played alongside, for those with headphones who prefer listening to reading. The proposed final product, which I shall not be developing in this project but will be worked on later if further expansion is required, will have multiple free stories for the user to choose from, all with different themes and lengths in order to satisfy everyone's fictional tastes, from Science Fiction to Fantasy to Horror. All stories are intended to have multiple endings, but only a few of them may be able to be completed for this demonstration. Expansion packs could be made later down the line, to generate more profit. These expansion packs could be more stories categorised under different genres, changes to the colour scheme of the user interface or general soft currency which could be used to purchase these features or more that we add in the future. Another idea that has been toyed with is the ability for players to gain achievements while playing which, in turn will give them the soft currency for free, meaning that users can gain access to the paid content without spending any money at all, it will just be significantly harder as they will not earn as much as those that pay. As the game is single player, balance is not an issue at all due to the fact that nothing that a player does will have any significance to any other player at all. A player can cheat through the entire game and it will have no consequence to the rest of the playerbase.

To recap, the project will have the following features:

* A basic story with two or three different outcomes
* Items that are required to perform various actions within the story
* A menu which allows the user to select stories that they have selected
* A UI which is easy to use
* An options page
* A credits page

## Analysis
### Outline
`Approach`
I have decided to approach the project by listing all the features that the client needs to have completed for a base product, what could be added to the project within the timescale and what may be added if there was a larger timespan on which to develop this program to it's full potential, if there were more time and resources available to me and my client. Some of the tasks that the client would like me to complete are:

* UI configuration
* Viewing stories grouped by genre
* Viewing stories grouped by last read
* Viewing stories grouped by user rating

The following are some tasks which would be possible if a second round of development were to be initiated, or if a longer timespan with more resources were to be used instead:

* Audio playing along with the user reader reading the story
* Access to a store page where users can purchase expansion packs and other downloadable content
* Ability to unlock and view achievements
* Ability to sign up to a web service in order to save and load progress, along with achievements and configuration profiles
* Ability to view leaderboards to see who has completed stories in the shortest amounts of time, with the most gear unlocked, who gained the most achievements and more
