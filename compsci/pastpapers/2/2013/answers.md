Question 3)

    1. A protocol is a set of rules governing the exchange of data between devices.

    2. A high level language interpreter interprets the code that is written into machine code, which is then translated into machine code for the processor to read and execute.

    3. Stored program is when a program that has been compiled needs to be executed again without being changed, instead of the program being recompiled the data is taken from the hard drive and is just executed under new parameters, effectively saving time by not having to compile the source each time.

    4. LOAD 21 //loads 21 (lmotor)
       STORE 21 23 //stores lmotor in temp
       ADD 21 -21 //sets lmotor to 0
       ADD 21 22 //sets lmotor to rmotor
       ADD 22 23 //sets rmotor to temp (lmotor prev speed)

    5. i. The robot has to check if the balls colour is X, and if it is not then check if it is Y and so on
