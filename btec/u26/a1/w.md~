# Unit XXVI Assignment I: Mattresses
*By Nathan Windisch*

## Data
The following data is used in PI, 

```
 M = [  3 -1 ]
     [  4  2 ]
```

```
 N = [  4  3 ]
     [ -1 -1 ]
```

```
 P = [ -1 24 ]
     [ -3 43 ]
```

```
     [ 1   35 ]
 Q = [ 4  -42 ]
     [ 2  -48 ]
```

```
     [  2  3  3 ]
 R = [  9  2  6 ]
     [ 12 -4  7 ]
```

```
      [ -6  3 ]
  S = [ -3 -2 ]
      [ -6  6 ]
```


## PI: Adding & Subtracting Matrices, Along With Demonstrating How Matrices Can Be Used To Represent Data

The following questions need to be answered:

a. M + N
b. P + Q
c. M - N
d. 3P
e. 3P - 2Q

The following are my answers to the question, with working out added to them as an intermediate step.

a. M + N = [3 -1]   [ 4  3]   [(3+ 4) (-1+ 3)]   [7 2]
           [4  2] + [-1 -1] = [(4+-1) ( 2+-1)] = [3 1]

b. P + Q = [-1 24]   [1  35]
           [-3 43] + [4 -42] = Undefined as their orders are not equal.
                     [2 -48]

c. M - N = [3 -1]   [ 4  3]   [(3-4) (-1- 3)]   [(3-4) (-1-3)]   [-1 -4]
           [4  2] - [-1 -1] = [(4--1 ( 2--1)] = [(4+1) ( 2+1)] = [ 5  3]

d. 3P = [-1 24]       [(-1\*3) (24\*3)]   [-3  72]
        [-3 43] \* 3 = [(-3\*3) (43\*3)] = [-9 129]

e. 3P + 2Q = ([-1 24]    )   ([1  35]    )
             ([-3 43] * 3) + ([4 -42] * 2) = Undefined as their orders are not equal.
                             ([2 -48]    )

I have also constructed a PowerPoint presentation on the subject of the use of Matrices in data analysis and how they can be compared to variables arrays in computer programming. Please see the next page for a print out of the presentation.

# PII: Multiplying Matrices

The following questions need to be answered:
*Please note that `.` is equal to `*` or `x`.*

a. M.N
b. P.Q
c. R.S
d. S.R

The following are my answers to the questions, along with the working out added to then as an intermediate step.

a. M . N = [3 -1]   [ 4  3]   [(3\* 4) (-1\* 3)]   [ 7 -3]
           [4  2] . [-1 -1] = [(4\*-1) ( 2\*-1)] = [-4 -2]

b. P . Q = [-1 24]   [1  35]
           [-3 43] . [4 -42] = Undefined as their orders are not equal.
                     [2 -48]

           [ 2  3 3]   [-6  3]
c. R . S = [ 9  2 6] . [-3 -2] = Undefined as their orders are not equal.
           [12 -4 7]   [-6  6]

          [-6  3]   [ 2  3 3]
d. S . R =[-3 -2] . [ 9  2 6] = Undefined as their orders are not equal.
          [-6  6]   [12 -4 7]
