# Unit VII Assignment III
*By Nathan Windisch*

## PIV - Policies and Guidelines Used To Manage Security Issues
There are many different policies regarding the management of IT threats to my area of work, which is a junior consultant at the local Internet Service Provider. To start of, an organizational policy is a rule that is enforced on all computer systems within an organization. These policies are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the system from an outside force, such as a computer hacker. This ensures the integrity of all files on the system, along with a peace of mind for all IT technicians working on the network as they do not have to deal with outside threats. Another reason for security policies within an organization is that it keeps employees focused and on task by disabling access to social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Reddit as well as games websites such as Miniclip and Steam. Also, material inappropriate to the workplace may be blocked, such as gambling and pornography. If an employee tries to access these types of websites, the IT team will be noticed and action shall be taken. A way that the IT team can take action against the perpetrators without delay.

All software installed on the system must go through the correct channels. For instance, if a user wants to install a specific program that must make a request to UTCISP's IT team with the name of the program, the official download location, any documentation that may come with the program and why they believe that it should be installed. The IT team shall then overview this request and, if they believe that the request is valid, testing will begin. Testing will involved installing the program on a virtual machine disconnected from the network, ensuring that it is compatible with the current software, ensuring that there are no bugs or glitches in the software and ensuring that the software does not contain any malicious code. Once all of this has been complete, a system wide update may be rolled out. If the software in question seems to have errors, bugs, malicious code or incompatibilities in it, both the IT team and the user that requested the software will be under fire.

Another policy that we follow at UTCISP is the usage of email. Email sent via official domains such as `UTCISP.org` must use professional wording and contain no vulgar or inappropriate material that could damage the company's reputation. Any emails sent by any staff member that are not work related or place UTCISP in a bad light will have their internet privileges revoked and may face termination. Any emails viewed or received on company property must be workplace appropriate and must not compromise the systems of UTCISP. Any damage caused by emails opened on company property will be considered the fault of the user that opened them, and may result in docking of pay or termination, depending on the severity of the attack. Also, unwanted emails must be deleted, and the recycling bin must be wiped periodically.

Another thing to note is the Data Protection Act of 1998. This act must be used in accordance with IT system moderation as it is a legal document that states how data must be protected. The following is a brief summary taken from https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act/

>The Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organizations, businesses or the government.
>
>Everyone responsible for using data has to follow strict rules called ‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information is:
>
>* used fairly and lawfully
>* used for limited, specifically stated purposes
>* used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
>* accurate
>* kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary
>* handled according to people’s data protection rights
>* kept safe and secure
>* not transferred outside the European Economic Area without adequate protection
>
>There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:
>* ethnic background
>* political opinions
>* religious beliefs
>* health
>* sexual health
>* criminal records

The Data Protection Act is used to protect the data that a company takes, and forces them to keep it regularly updated and removed from their databases if it is no longer required. The data must not be gained unlawfully, such as scams or phishing, and it must be kept safe and secure. Sensitive data must not contain the person's ethnicity, religion, politick views, health (including sexual health) or criminal records, unless otherwise stated, such as if those in possession of the data are a government facility or program, and if the user has permitted that facility or program access. The act was implemented to protect private citizen's data, and to ensure that companies are not using their data for nefarious or illegal purposes.

One important rule for performing security management and removing threats is to be 100% sure that the system edits that you are performing cannot negatively impact the legitimate users of the system. One way of ensuring that this rule is followed is be performing vigorous tests on the edits that you are performing. One way that this can be done is via trying to access the system as a regular user after performing the changes on a local machine. This means that any errors that are encountered are the same as what a legitimate user would face. After testing has been carried out, all bugs can be quashed.

## PV - Employment Contracts: How They Can Support Or Obstruct An Organization
Employment Contracts are, as defined on the official government webpage here (https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview):

>All employees have an employment contract with their employer. A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee’s:
>
>* employment conditions
>* rights
>* responsibilities
>* duties
>* These are called the ‘terms’ of the contract.
>
>Employees and employers must stick to a contract until it ends (eg by an employer or employee giving notice or an employee being dismissed) or until the terms are changed (usually by agreement between the employee and employer).

<img src="http://www.howellslegal.co.uk/news/image.axd?picture=2014%2F6%2Femployment-contract.jpg" width="75%">

To sum up, an Employment Contract is what an employee signs up to, to ensure that their rights and responsibilities are not violated during their time working at the company. Both the employer and the employee have to agree to these legally binding words for the employee to start working at the company, and if the employer breaks these terms then the employee can sue. However, if the employee breaks these terms, the employer has the right to terminate their job.

### Advantages
The main advantage of an Employment Contract is that it allows the job description to be highly specific; both the employer and the employee knows what they should be doing, and at what pay their job is at. It also allows for an employer to entrust the employee with specific trade secrets, as the Employment Contract can act as a Non-Disclosure Agreement. The document is also useful as it allows for the employer or employee to settle disputes later down the line, if the employer is not paying enough or if the employee is not doing their job, for example. The document can be used as written evidence in a court of law, if required. Also, Employment Contracts are also a good way for an employer and an employee to have a positive relationship, as the employer knows that the employee fully understands their role in the company, and the employee has a certain level of job security knowing that their role is set and cannot be changed against their favor without their permission.

### Disadvantages
One disadvantage of having an Employment Contract is that it make it hard for an employee to change job if they are in the middle of a contract with a specific time frame. Also, the Contract can result in rather static job roles, meaning that responsibilities and salary cannot be negotiated easily.

### Conclusion
To conclude, it is generally better to have an Employment Contract as it allows for a legal standpoint to be made, along with job security for both the employee and the employer.

## PVI - Legislation: Data Privacy Laws and Data Security Policies
### Privacy Laws
A Privacy Law is a law that enables the seclusion of a user on the internet, enabling them peace of mind when inputting data as they know that the misuse of this material is illegal. There are many different Privacy Laws in the United Kingdom that cover many different areas, including communication, finance, home, online, health and information. As this assignment is only about the use of internet Privacy, I shall only talk about Privacy Acts relating to activities online and Privacy Acts regarding information. These laws are important to UTC ISP as we deal with lots and lots of other people's network traffic, meaning that we need to follow these laws to the letter.

<img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAOQAAAAJDhlMTI0NzRhLTc2NGUtNDRiOC05YjAwLWEzYWY2ZWQ1YWMwZg.jpg" width=50%"">

The first law I shall be discussing is the Data Protection Act of 1998. The following is a brief summary taken from https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act/

>The Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organizations, businesses or the government.
>
>Everyone responsible for using data has to follow strict rules called ‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information is:
>
>* used fairly and lawfully
>* used for limited, specifically stated purposes
>* used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
>* accurate
>* kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary
>* handled according to people’s data protection rights
>* kept safe and secure
>* not transferred outside the European Economic Area without adequate protection
>
>There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:
>* ethnic background
>* political opinions
>* religious beliefs
>* health
>* sexual health
>* criminal records

To summarize, this law enables the fair use and storage of data, and does not allow it to be misused or inaccurate. It also requires that the data is updated regularly and removed when no longer needed.

On the flip side of this, there is the Freedom of information Act of 2000. This act enables private citizens to be able to access all public public records, including government facilities and instituations. The following is an extract from the document.

>The main principle behind freedom of information legislation is that people have a right to know about the activities of public authorities, unless there is a good reason for them not to. This is sometimes described as a presumption or assumption in favour of disclosure. The Act is also sometimes described as purpose and applicant blind.
>
>This means that:
>
>* everybody has a right to access official information. Disclosure of information should be the default – in other words, information should be kept private only when there is a good reason and it is permitted by the Act;
>* an applicant (requester) does not need to give you a reason for wanting the information. On the contrary, you must justify refusing them information;
>* you must treat all requests for information equally, except under some circumstances relating to vexatious requests and personal data (see When can we refuse a request? for details on these). The information someone can get under the Act should not be affected by who they are. You should treat all requesters equally, whether they are journalists, local residents, public authority employees, or foreign researchers; and
>* because you should treat all requesters equally, you should only disclose information under the Act if you would disclose it to anyone else who asked. In other words, you should consider any information you release under the Act as if it were being released to the world at large.

### Security Laws

There are also Security Laws that need to be evaluated and abided by. The main law that I shall be covering in this segment is the Computer Misuse Act of 1990. This act was created as a response to the *R v Gold & Schifreen* case, as there were no real laws to charge Gold & Schifreen with. The main three points of the Act are outlined as follows, as seen from Wikipedia page here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Misuse_Act_1990

>* unauthorised access to computer material, punishable by 12 months' imprisonment (or 6 months in Scotland) and/or a fine "not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale" (since 2015, unlimited);
>* unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences, punishable by 12 months/maximum fine (or 6 months in Scotland) on summary conviction and/or 5 years/fine on indictment;
>* unauthorised modification of computer material, punishable by 12 months/maximum fine (or 6 months in Scotland) on summary conviction and/or 10 years/fine on indictment;

As you can see, these laws are scaling and have a minimum of 12 months jail time, up to a maximum jail time of 10 years or an unlimited fine.
