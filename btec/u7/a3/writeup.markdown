## PIV - Policies and Guidelines Used To Manage Security Issues
There are many different policies regarding the management of IT threats to my area of work, which is a junior consultant at the local Internet Service Provider. To start of, an organizational policy is a rule that is enforced on all computer systems within an organization. These policies are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the system from an outside force, such as a computer hacker. This ensures the integrity of all files on the system, along with a peace of mind for all IT technicians working on the network as they do not have to deal with outside threats. Another reason for security policies within an organization is that it keeps employees focused and on task by disabling access to social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Reddit as well as games websites such as Miniclip and Steam. Also, material inappropriate to the workplace may be blocked, such as gambling and pornography. If an employee tries to access these types of websites, the IT team will be noticed and action shall be taken. A way that the IT team can take action against the perpetrators without delay.

All software installed on the system must go through the correct channels. For instance, if a user wants to install a specific program that must make a request to UTCISP's IT team with the name of the program, the official download location, any documentation that may come with the program and why they believe that it should be installed. The IT team shall then overview this request and, if they believe that the request is valid, testing will begin. Testing will involved installing the program on a virtual machine disconnected from the network, ensuring that it is compatible with the current software, ensuring that there are no bugs or glitches in the software and ensuring that the software does not contain any malicious code. Once all of this has been complete, a system wide update may be rolled out. If the software in question seems to have errors, bugs, malicious code or incompatibilities in it, both the IT team and the user that requested te software will be under fire.

Another policy that we follow at UTCISP is the usage of email. Email sent via official domains such as `UTCISP.org` must use professional wording and contain no vulgar or inappropriate material that could damage the company's reputation. Any emails sent by any staff member that are not work related or place UTCISP in a bad light will have their internet privileges revoked and may face termination. Any emails viewed or received on company property must be workplace appropriate and must not compromise the systems of UTCISP. Any damage caused by emails opened on company property will be considered the fault of the user that opened them, and may result in docking of pay or termination, depending on the severity of the attack.

One important rule for performing security management and removing threats is to be 100% sure that the system edits that you are performing cannot negatively impact the legitimate users of the system. One way of ensuring that this rule is followed is be performing vigorous tests on the edits that you are performing. One way that this can be done is via trying to access the system as a regular user after performing the changes on a local machine. This means that any errors that are encountered are the same as what a legitimate user would face. After testing has been carried out, all bugs can be quashed.
