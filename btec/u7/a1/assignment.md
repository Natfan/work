# Unit VII Assignment I: Knowing Your Threats

*By Nathan Windisch*

## MI: Informational Security

### Informational Security
Informational Security is highly important as it allows for data owned by both
businesses and private individuals to be protected. Keeping an IT system secure
is one of the most important system traits as without it then the system can be
accessed by outside intruders and your data can be stolen. If informational
security is not in place then your personal data is also at risk, possibly
resulting in identity theft and fraud caused on your personal or business
information.

### Threat I: External Malware Attacks
External Malware attacks are very dangerous and can cause lots of damage of
let into our system, via FTP, SSH or even email. As we are an Internet Service
Provider, or ISP it would be a massive breach of both trust from our users and
a catastrophic failure of our previously effective security if malware were to
get sent into the system as many people who use our systems could be infected,
resulting in mass loss of data and a subsequent loss of profits due to customers
cancelling their contracts with us as there has been a data breach, resulting in
a loss of trust. A way to keep your systems and data secure would be to prevent
access to protcols such as FTP, SSH and email, unless it has been authorised by
a senior member of the IT team here at UTCISP.


### Threat II: Phishing
Phishing is a major issue to our company as an Internet Service Provider as it
can give scammers a way to gain access to data owned by either a business or a
private person or people who use our systems. Phishing can be very effective
towards individuals who trust official looking documents, even if they are not
legitimate. Individuals that are included in this list are old people, who are
not computer literate, and people with bad eyesight as they may not notice
certain details about an email which may prove it's invalidity. This practice
can be detrimental to our industry as if a phishing email is sent from an
official email, many customers may be affected by it, leading to a loss in both
the amount of trust given to us by our users and the profits that we gain from
their subscriptions to our services. A way to keep your systems and data secure
would be to send all email traffic that isn't sent by an authorised address
to a spam folder for security. A downside to this is that some legitimate
emails may be caught in the filter.


### Threat III: DoS/DDoS
With a DoS attack, or Denial of Service attack, the resultant attack is hard to
block without disabling access to legitimate outside users. DDoS attacks can
result in downtime, meaning that our users may stop using our services,
resulting in a loss of monitary income. A way to keep your systems and data
secure is to have it all backed up onto an external site to prevent the data
from being inaccessible. The data could also be sent to multiple servers to
prevent any other DDoS attacks hitting the offsite servers.


### Threat IV: BotNets
A BotNet allows hackers to gain access to all computers on our network, meaning
that they can use the computer as a ‘slave’, using it to do things using their
internet connection to perform things like DDoS attacks, as aforementioned, or
using their processing power to perform things such as brute-forcing or bitcoin
mining. BotNets will mean that our users lose trust in our services and move
over to another ISP, resulting in a mass loss of profits. A way to keep your
system and data secure would be to use a similar idea from some of the issues
listed previously, such as filtering email sent from unknown sources and
storing all your data on an offsite backup facility, such a services including
Google Drive, Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive.
