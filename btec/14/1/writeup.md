### What is Event Driven Programming?
Event Driven Programming is the usage of events to define the outcome of the program. Events can be actions performed by the user, such as mouse clicks or key presses, inputs from sensors, or from calls sent by another thread. This means that the most programs that are written today that have some sort of user interactive feature are based on code that is event driven, due to the fact that having actions that respond to the user are inherently event driven. The following are some examples of programming languages that utilize event driven architecture:
* Java
* Visual C++
* Visual Basic
While all of these programing languages are similar and can do the same things, some are better suited to certain tasks than others. For instance, Visual Basic is better suited for entry level programming as it can make quick GUI based programs for easy access. Visual C++ is used for powerful but small programs that need to either work fast or work on systems with low amounts of resources such as imbedded systems. This includes clocks in washing machines and microwaves, for example. Java is a more general purpose language that is used for making programs with high levels of compatibility as it works across many devices without the need of rewriting any code.

### What Are Event Driven Systems
Event Driven Systems are programs that have everything determined by the output
