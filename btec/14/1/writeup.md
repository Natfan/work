### What is Event Driven Programming?
Event Driven Programming is the usage of events to define the outcome of the program. Events can be actions performed by the user, such as mouse clicks or key presses, inputs from sensors, or from calls sent by another thread. This means that the most programs that are written today that have some sort of user interactive feature are based on code that is event driven, due to the fact that having actions that respond to the user are inherently event driven. The following are some examples of programming languages that utilize event driven architecture:

* Java
* Visual C++
* Visual Basic

### What Are Event Driven Systems
Event Driven Systems are programs that have everything determined by the output
