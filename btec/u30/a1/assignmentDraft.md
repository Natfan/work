# Unit XXX Assignment I: Graphical Software and Design

*By Nathan Windisch*

## TASK I: Hardware and Software used in Graphic Design

### PI: Key Components in Graphic Design

One of the main hardware pieces that are used in graphic design is the central
processing unit, or CPU. the CPU is used as the main computing part of a system
and can be used for many things such as allow faster loading times, quicker
editing times and an easier way to export your files. another component used in
graphic design is the monitor. the monitor is used to output what is happening
on the computer for the user to see. one thing that should be kept in mind when
purchasing a monitor is that the higher the resolution of the screen, the more
pixels will be available for use, resulting in higher resolution image editing
and a better overall product.

Another part of the system that is crucial to graphical design is the storage
device used. one type of storage device is a hard disk drive, which stores the
data on a physical disk. while HDDs are generally cheaper and can store more
data than their than their counterparts, the solid state drive, they are much
slower. on the flip side of the coin, solid state drives, or SSDs, store data as
flash storage meaning that any data can be saved and retrieved almost
instantaneously. the downsides to SSDs is that they can cost up to ten times
the price of a hard disk drive for the same storage capacity, meaning that the
price of the system can increase at an alarming rate very quickly.

In addition, random access memory is a vital part of the graphic design process,
or RAM. RAM is useful as it allows more programs to be run at once and it also
allows more resource intensive programs to run quicker. RAM comes in a few
different forms, or generations, and the latest type of RAM is DDR4, which is
considered the best but can be very expensive as it is quite new to the scene.
most computers that have been made within the last decade use DDR3 RAM, which is
quite cheap now. In fact, it is so commonly used that most computers have eight
or even sixteen gigabytes of DDR3 RAM. In the future it will be DDR4 RAM that is
used, resulting in even faster computer systems.

Another component used in a computer system is a graphical processing unit, or
GPU. the GPU works alongside the CPU to ease the load of graphically intensive
applications, meaning that the CPU can perform more instructions, essentially
making the computer faster. the better the GPU is, the faster both the computer
will be and subsequently the graphics editing process will be quicker, along
with lower exporting and rendering times.

Another type of component in graphic design is the software that is used. most
people use windows, which is the most popular operating system and is available
on most computers for a price of ~$120 or ~Â£95. OSX is another operating system
which is developed by Apple and is exclusive to their devices only. The third
main operating system is Linux, an open source operating system with thousands
of different 'sub' operating systems called 'distributions' (or 'distros' for
short). Linux is free and very lightweight, but it does not have as many pieces
of software that are compatible with the system. For maximum ease and access to
the largest range of software I would recommend using Windows with Linux running
in the background under a virtual machine, just in case you want to run some
programs that require a Linux machine.

Another key component to graphic design is raster graphics and vector graphics.
while not hardware or technically a specific type of software (more of a method
of editing image), these two principles are key to good graphical design), these
two principles are key to good graphical design. raster graphics are graphics
that are created using pixels instead of coordinates. this makes them easier to
create as only the pixels need to be edited in a RGB format. this means that
they have over 16.5 million colors available as that is 255 Red shades times 255
Green shades times 255 Blue shades, resulting in 255^3 or 16,581,375 available
color combinations. Raster is better for large images that will not change size
as when a raster image is resized the pixels that are edited will stay the same,
resulting in image quality degradation.

The flip side of the coin is vector graphics. this type of graphic uses
coordinates and RGB to denote how the image is formed, where it is on the screen
and what colors are used. more basic images such as a square or a smiley face
will be very small files as there will be only a few commands required to make
the image. larger vector graphics can take up lots of space however, as there is
lots of data required to produce the image. a good thing about vector graphics
is that it can be resized to be as big or as small as needed and it will still
have the same resolution and image quality as is not individual pixels needed to
make the image, but rather lines that are drawn with specific coordinates.
vector graphics can be harder to make as it takes a lot more effort and skill to
make even the smallest images, whereas it is very easy to make basic images with
raster graphics.

## TASK II: Comparing Hardware and Software

### MI: Hardware and Software Comparisons

There are many different ways that a computer system can perform different
tasks, which is why the computer market is so good as theoretically every
computers system can be different, resulting in a diverse range of product
companies and vendors. This means that there are many different ways of doing
functions that most computers can do, including, but not limited to:

* Storage of files
* Display output
* Capturing the output

I shall explain all of these functions briefly and I shall then go in depth of
the pros and cons of all of the different ways of performing these functions.

The first item on the list is the storage of files or, more specifically, the
way that they are stored on the physical memory. The most commonly used way of
data storage is on physical disks which stores the data on a spinning disk that
rotates when different data needs to be accessed. These are called Hard Disk
Drives, or HDDs, and most personal computers that use Hard Disk Drives spin
between 5,400 RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) and 10,000 RPM, with most desktop
PC Hard Disk Drives spinning at 7,200 RPM. The fastest Hard Disk Drive spins at
15,000 RPM, but this is not normally used by consumers and more used by
enterprise businesses that want to access data quickly. Speaking of accessing
data quickly, a disk spinning at 5,400 RPM will be half of the speed as a
disk spinning at 10,800RPM, meaning that the slower disk will access data at a
slower speed when compared to the faster disk, meaning that tasks take a longer
time to complete with a slower disk. Because of this, you would presume that one
should purchase a faster disk to make your computer faster, but this is not the
case as there is another type of disk that can be used.

The Solid State Drive, or SSD, is another device that is used to store data.
Solid State Drives are a store data in such a way that means that is retrievable
up to 30% faster than a Hard Disk Drive. It does this by storing the data on a
flash storage, meaning that there is no physical disk to read and write the
data. Instead, the data is stored on something called 'flash' memory, a similar
protocol to RAM. The difference between Random Access Memory, or RAM and a
Solid State Drive is that the Solid State Drive keeps it's data if power is
lost, whereas Random Access Memory does not. Random Access Memory is called
"volatile" memory as it is cleared when it loses power, whereas SSDs are "non
volatile" as the data is kept if power is lost.

There are a few different types of display output that computers can use, but I
shall only be discussing the two most used ones in this report as one of them is
the main analog type and the other is the main digital type. The digital type
that I shall be discussing is HDMI, and the analog type is VGA. HDMI, or High
Definition Multimedia Interface, is a newish standard for monitor output released
in 2002. HDMI is used by many different manufacturers, and has become a
standard for monitors and TV screen, and is considered much better than it's
analog as it is more reliable and it pipes audio as well. HDMI is also on more
current systems as VGA is being phased out due to being obsolete.

VGA is an older format that was created in 1987. As it is so old, many monitors
and screens that have been made within the last half decade may not even have VGA
ports. VGA is also harder to use, due to the fact that it has screws on both sides
to secure the plug in place, instead of the more stable plug based system of HDMI,
which is similar to DVI and can be compared to USB. Also, given that VGA is an
older format, many monitors and screens may not be compatible with the technology,
and may require a superior port that was made more recently.

The third thing that I shall discuss is the different methods of capturing the output
on the monitor, namely the software or hardware used. On the software side of things,
there are many different products with different pros and cons. For instance, Mirillis'
Action! is a piece of software that records what is on your screen, including where
your mouse is and when you click. It also records your computer's audio and can record
your microphone input as well. Other software that does similar things are:

* Fraps
* Dxtory
* Camtasia
* Bandicam
* Adobe Captivate
* XSplit
* ShareX
* HyperCam

All of these pieces of software are CPU intensive, so it is a good idea to have a decent
central processing unit before considering screen recording.

Also on the software side of things, there is another type of software, provided by some
graphics card providers, that records what is being sent to the screen via the GPU,
meaning that the CPU is free to run other programs and, as long as they are not
graphically intensive, should not perform a hit to your performance. Nvidia graphics cards
come with ShadowPlay, and AMD graphics cards come with Raptr. Both are similar systems,
but are exclusive to only Nvidia/AMD graphics cards respectively.

## TASK III: File Formats

### PII: Types of File Formats

One of the main types of file formats that are widely used throughout the
internet are .jpeg files. JPEG files are stored under .jpeg, .jpg, .jpe and
others. In JPEG files, each pixel requires three bytes to record it's color. All
three bytes can have a number between 0 and 255, meaning that each pixel can
have it's Red, Green and Blue values stored individually. JPEG also uses YPbPr,
which is derived from RGB and is used for find the brightness of a pixel and is
also used for connectivity to TV ports. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic
Experts Group, the group that created the format, and was created in 1992.

Another type of format that is used commonly is .bmp files. BMP files are stored
under .bmp or .dib and it stands for BitMaP. Bitmap files are generated
similarly to PNG files, but it is lossless. this means that no parts of the
image are lost when saving, resulting in larger files. Bitmap means that each
pixel (bit) is placed (mapped) onto the screen individually, similar to the way
PNG works.

Yet another type of file format that is used on the internet, albeit less
commonly is .fla, or Flash. Flash files are created by Adobe Flash (formerly
Macromedia Flash and Shockwave Flash) and is used for creating advertisements,
banners, animations, movies, apps and games. Flash files can be saved under .fla
(FLAsh), .flv (FLash Video) and .swf (Small Web Format). Flash files can display
images (both still and moving) using both Raster and Vector, audio and text, it
can also capture mouse movement and keyboard input, along with camera input.

.svg files are a type of file that is used to generate vector graphics. SVG
stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and can be stored under .svg and .svgz. SVG
files are stored as XML files, allowing for easy editing of the image with an
image editor or without, if you have the technical knowhow. As SVG files are
vector based, they can be resized to any size and still have the same quality.
All modern browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari and
Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge, support this file format.

One of the most popular file formats on the internet is .gif files. GIFs are
moving images that are commonly used to convey emotions or reactions to things
said on social media. GIFs are also used to show short clips from videos or
TV shows. GIF files are lossless, meaning that no data is lost when sent across
the internet. GIF also use good compression, meaning that they are smaller than
BMP files. Sadly GIFs are indexed, meaning that there can only be a maximum of
256 colors in a file.

## TASK IV: Legal Implications

### PVI: Legal Implications and Copyright Law

There are many legal implications to uploading image files to the internet. One
of these is the Data Protection Act. This law was enacted in 1998 and was
created to combat theft of data, code and ideas. It is enforced in the UK and
Northern Ireland and is the main law that protects the data withheld by the
general public in the UK. It was created to fall into line with EU regulations
about data protection on the internet. Anyone holding personal data for other
purposes is legally obliged to comply with this Act.

Another law that was created is the Computer Misuse act. This law was enacted in
1990 and was created after the R v Gold & Schifreen incident. The pair found out
the username and password of a high up BT engineer. With this password they
accessed lots of confidential data and made a mockery of BTâs security. As there
was no laws in place to punish them, they were fined Â£750~ each and laws were
put in place to stop it happening again.

Both of these two laws prevent unauthorized use of computers and the files on
them, meaning that you have to obey these laws or you may go to prison.

There are a few places where you can legally obtain images from. One is any
image that is published under open source licensing, meaning that is it freely
available for anyone to use. The licensee can also add clauses to force the user
of their work to give credit, but this is optional.

Another place that can be used to obtain images legal is websites such as
Shuttershock, Photobucket and StockPhotos. As long as these are paid for by the
intended user, they can be used for anything that the license allows. These
images can also be used for free, as long as the watermark is kept in the image.

## TASK V: Impacts of Output Mediums

### DI: Changes in Output Mediums

#### Dot Matrix
##### History
The Dot Matrix printer was invented in the 1920s, but wasn't really used until in
the early to mid 1960s and used an up-and-down, back-and-forth motion to print
each 'pixel' individually. They were moved from the printing press industry to
smaller businesses and personal use in the 1970s and 1980s.

##### Speed
A Dot Matrix printer can print from about 30 to over 1550 characters per second,
but the higher the characters per second, the lower the quality of the output. This
means that Dot Matrix printers with a high character per second rate would be used
almost exclusively for text based industries, such as newspapers.

##### Cost
The cost of a Dot Matrix printer in 2012 can be between $250 and $600, with pages
costing between $0.15 and $0.20 per page.

##### Overall
Dot Matrix printers should be phased out due to their inefficiency. They were good
for their time, but better methods have been invented since then. They are also very
noisy, producing a loud buzzing sound as it prints and even though there are sound
deafening devices, there are much quieter options.

#### Laser Printers
##### History
Laser printers are the successor to dot matrix printers, and were first invented and
in the late 1960s, but were not used commercially until the mid 1970s in data
centers, where line printers were attached to mainframe computers. The first
commercial laser printer was created by IBM and was called the IBM 3800.

##### Speed
A typical laser printers can print about four full colour pages per minute, or about
25 black and white colour pages per minute. This is approximately half the speed of
a dot matrix printer, but is much quieter and more efficient.

##### Cost
The lowest price that you can find for a laser printer is about $100, but normally
one will find a printer for about $150. The most expensive laser printer is about
$600. Laser printers cost between $0.01 and $0.09 per page, but lots of this cost
is factored into ink cartridges, which can be rather expensive.

##### Overall
While dot matrix printers are faster and cheaper than laser printers, laser printers
are much quieter. Laser printers are also more compatible with current systems,
whereas it would take a lot more time and effort to get a dot matrix printer to work
with a common desktop.

#### Palm Pilot
##### History
The Palm Pilot was a Personal Digital Assistant that was released in 1996, long
before the invention of the 'smartphone'. The Pilot had a black and white
'touchscreen' that had to use a stylus or a fingernail to use. It had 6 physical
buttons at the bottom, and the touchscreen could only be used in a certain area.
It had a painting application that could be used for pixel art and quick sketches.

##### Speed
The Pilot Personal had 512KB of storage and the Pilot Professional had 1MB of
storage. Not many other features and specifications about the Palm Pilot are
available on the internet, due to it's age and lack of use.
##### Cost
The Pilot Personal cost $299 and the Pilot Professional cost $399. Upgrade kits were
also sold at $99. These upgrade kits contained IR blasters, new memory doors to
compliment the IR diodes, CD-ROMs with upgraded software and memory cards with
1MB of space.
##### Overall
The Palm Pilots were considered highly advanced back in 1996, when the internet was
being formed and there were little to no handheld devices. When comparing it to the
iPhone, the features and specifications seem lacking.

#### iPhone
##### History
The iPhone was invented in 2007 and is widely considered one of the most revolutionary
products of the early 21st century. The iPhone was one of the first phones to feature
a touchscreen that actually worked with your fingers, rather than using a stylus. The
iPhone paved the way for current smartphones, and Apple, the creators of the iPhone,
have since released a new version every year. It had an app store that contains many
photo editing tools.

##### Speed
The first iPhone had 4, 8 and 16GB of flash (SSD) memory, depending on which
version was purchased It had 128MB of Random Access Memory and ran iOS 1.0. It
also could connect to the internet, either via mobile data (GSM, GPRS or EDGE) or
via WiFi. The iPhone also had Bluetooth 2.0 connectivity and featured a USB 2.0 port
for data transfer and charging.

##### Cost
The cost of the first iPhone with 8GB of internal storage was $499, but it was later
dropped to $399 three months after the release. After many upset emails from early
adopters, Apple gave out many $200 store credit vouches to avoid backlash.

##### Overall
The iPhone was a huge success that sold it's one millionth device within five days.
The iPhone paved the way for many other devices, and changed the way ordinary people
use technology. Today, the number of smartphones is thought to be about 2.1 billion.
