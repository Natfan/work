# Unit XXVI Assignment II
*By Nathan Windisch*

## Task I
 **i)** Find a formula for the `nth` term of this sequence and find the `17th` term using your `nth` term formula. Also calculate the **sum of the first 17 terms of this sequence**.


-3, 1, 5, 9, 13 ... = `4n-3`

`4n-3`

`1n..17n` = -3, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61

**ii)** Find a formula for the nth term of this sequence and find the 10th term using your nth term formula. Also calculate the sum to the 5th term and the sum to infinity of this sequence.

81, -27, 9, -3 ... = `Xn+/-Y`

`Xn+/-Y`

`15n` =

`âˆžn` =

**iii)**
Find the following where R=1.

((3r-2r^2+r^3) \* 6) =

((3\*1)-((2\*1)^2)+(1^3)) =

((3)-(2^2)+(3)) =

(3-4+3) =

6\*(4-3+3) =

6\*4 =
