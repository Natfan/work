f a question has a sum symbol with a number at the top and (letter=number) at the bottom, it may look like this:

10
SUM (6-5n)
n=1

The you need to do the sum 10 times over, the first time with n equating to 1, the n-2, then n=3 and so forth.

the answer to all of these are:
1+(-4)+(-9)+(-14)+(-19)+(-24)+(-29)+(-34)+(-39)+(-44)
which is -215
