\section{Task I}
The following are answers to questions set for the first task.
\subsection{Question I}
Find a formula for the \textsc{nth} term of this sequence and find the \textsc{17th} term using your \textsc{nth} term formula. Also calculate the \textbf{sum of the first 17 terms of this sequence}.

\texttt{Sequence: -3, 1, 5, 9, 13 ...}
\texttt{Formula: 4n-3 as the diffence between all the numbers is 4 and the sequence starts at -3}
\texttt{1n..17n = -3, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61}

\subsection{Question II}
Find a formula for the \textsc{nth} term of this sequence and find the \textsc{10th} term using your \textsc{nth} term formula. Also calculate the \textbf{sum to the 5th term} and the \textbf{sum to infinity} of this sequence.

\texttt{81, -27, 9, -3 ... = Xn+/-Y}
\texttt{Xn+/-Y}
\texttt{15n =}
\texttt{âˆžn =}

\subsection{Question III}
Find the solution to $$\sum_{r=1}^6 (3r - 2r^2 + r^3)$$

Substituting the Rs for 1s.
$$\sum_{r=1}^6 ((3 \times 1) - (2 \times 1^2) + (1^3))$$

Working out the brackets.
$$\sum^6 (3 - (2 \times 2) + 1)$$

Final solution within the brackets.
$$\sum^6 (3 - 4 + 1)$$

Final solution without the brackets
$$\sum^6 (2)$$

Therefore we need to divide the final number by 6 to get the \textsc{sum} as we need to balance both sides of the equation.
$$\sum (\frac{2}{6})$$

Ergo:
$$0.\dot3$$
