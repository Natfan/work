## PI: Web Architecture and Components
### Internet Service Provider
An Internet Service Provider is a company that provides access to the internet to their customers. This is done by selling equipment to their customers. This equipment can be hardware such as routers and cabling, or software such as localhost webserver access to control the hardware remotely. Internet Service Providers have many different types of customers, including private citizens, small businesses and large corporations. Because all of these different groups have different needs, mulitple packages must be issued. For instance, a private individual will not need the same internet speeds and bandwidth as a datacenter, meaning that they will not expect to pay the same price. As a result, the structure of the hardware and software that the Internet Service Provider leased must be flexible to accomodate all these different needs.

### Web Hosting Services
A Web Hosting Service is a company that sells access to web servers in order to allow their clients access to publish websites on the World Wide Web. Web Hosting Services traditionally only sell access to small parts of dedicated servers, along with access to a web panel for file access and updating contact details and the like. Most Web Hosts will also give access to FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, as external programs are normally better than in-house, online file transferance tools due to their extended capabilites.

### Domain Structure
A Domain Structure is mainly constituted of Top-Level Domains, or TLDs, which are used to allow the user access to the website. Common TLDs are `.com`, `.net` and `.org`, but other domain level types exist. An example of this are country-code top level domains, such as `.uk`, `.de`, `.fr` and `.us`. There is also Second-Level domains, which are normally used to designate a region in a country. The main use of this is official state sites in America. The default CCLD in the United States is `.us`, but if the state of Ohio requires offical websites then they will use `<website>.oh.us`, to prove it's legitimacy.

### Domain Name Registrar
A Domain Name Registrar is a company that sells access to domain names. Domain Name Registrars are allowed to request that new domain names are made and, for the right price, can have exclusive access to them. An example of this is when Google, the search engine and software giant, purchased the rights to the `.app` domain for $25M. Other custom domain names which have been requested and subsequently purchased by companies, rather than ICANN generating them and then giving everyone access, include: `.axa`, `.cisco`, `.htc` and `.windows`. All of these domains can only be used by the companies that own them, or any persons or businesses that are allowed access.

### World Wide Web
The World Wide Web is a series of internet servers that allow users to access different documents and files. Users may navigate the World Wide Web via hyperlinks. The World Wide Web should not be confused with the **Internet**. The World Wide Web is the framework or structure of the Internet. The World Wide Web is only one part of the Internet, and other protocols such as `FTP` and `SMTP` use the Internet but are not classified as the World Wide Web.

### Internet
The Web, or the Internet, is different from the World Wide Web in that it is a "network of networks". The Internet is formed of many protocols, including `WWW`, `FTP`, `SSH`, `SMTP` and more. The Internet is a global network of servers and systems that allow users to accss information from many of the aforementioned protocols.

### Email
Email is a main method of communication via electronic means. Messages sent via Email can have more than one recipient. Many different prodiders allow their users to access their emails in browser, such as Outlook, Gmail and Yahoo. Companies such as Microsoft also prodide desktop applications for their users to use, such as Microsoft Outlook. Finally, some people write their own email clients using the specific protocols provided such as POP3, IMAP and SMTP.

### Proxy Server
A proxy server is a server that acts as a "middleman" to some networks. Proxy servers are used to relinquish strain on infrastructure via spreading the load if lots of users are using it, but they can also be used to hide the user's location due to privacy concerns, the reason normally being that they either do not want the website to track them or because the website that they are viewing is illegal in their country. Proxy servers can be used by servers, as aforementioned, to prevent the user accessing the site's server location as they do not connect to the server itself, they are routed through a proxy. This means that home webservers are secure from DDoS attacks, along with doxing.

### Browser
A browser, or web brower, is a GUI, or graphical user interface, which parses HTML files into their appropriate output, meaning that users can view them when accessing the World Wide Web. Web Browsers can also do other things such as access other protocols like FTP, run code injected in HTML pages such as Javascript and PHP, and can also be used for sending emails via the `webmail` Protocol. 

### TCP/IP
TCP/IP is a group of rules that are the basis for communication protocols on the Internet. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP/IP can also be considered for use in a communication protocol in a private network, such as intranet or extranet. TCP/IP is useful as it enables two different hosts to exchange data streams via a connection which has been established. TCP/IP also gives users the guarrantee of data delivery in the same order that it was sent. TCP/IP is better than IP as it allows for data streams that are not based around packets, whereas IP is based solely around the transferance of packets.

### Application Layer
The Application Layer is the seventh layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) System. It contains process-to-process protocols and well built interfaces for communication across an IP network. It can also be used for end-user services. It is named as such because it is the final layer of the OSI system and is the layer that actually interfaces with the user, ergo it is called the Application Layer.

### Flow Diagram
A flow diagram, or flow chart, is a method of displaying the sequence of actions of items within a system. This can include the movement or communication between people and also the dynamic between smaller machines. It is called a Flow Diagram because it shows the transition between steps, similar to how a waterfall transfers water from one place to another.

## PII: Client & Server Side Features
### Client Side Factors
#### Browser
A browser, or web brower, is a GUI, or graphical user interface, which parses HTML files into their appropriate output, meaning that users can view them when accessing the World Wide Web. Web Browsers can also do other things such as access other protocols like FTP, run code injected in HTML pages such as Javascript and PHP, and can also be used for sending emails via the `webmail` Protocol. There are many different browers, but the most widely used browers are Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Internet Explorer. Many web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera, are open-source whereas Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer are close-source. Chrome is so open-source, Opera is actually based off it. 

#### Cache
Cache, also known as Memory Cache; Cache Store or RAM Cache, is a method of storing data which will be used over and over again. Cache is stored in High-Speed Static Random Access Memory, or SRAM, as it is is much faster but more expensive. This means that Cache is relatively small and is used for programs which will use the same data again and again.

#### Memory
Memory is a large defintion which covers many different components of a computer. One type of Memory is Random Access Memory, or RAM, which is volatile memory which is wiped when power is disconnected. Another type of Memory is Read-Only Memory, or ROM, which is data which is written onto the chip and cannot be changed. Unlike RAM, ROM is non-volitle and cannot be changed.

#### Processor Speed
Processor Speed is an important component in Client Side Systems as processors with higher speeds can run more programs. Now adays many programs have a minimum requirements in order to actually run, and this number is measured in megahertz and gigahertz, or MHz and GHz.


### Server Side Factors
#### Web Server Capability
Web Server Caoability is the amount of hardware that the physical server has. A Web Server is a computer system that is connected to the internet and contains software that allows it to deliver web pages. A few examples of the software that are used are Apache and IIS, and they allow access to the web pages via the HTTP protocol.

#### Available Bandwidth
Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be sent over a specific static amount of time. Bandwidth is normally expressed via bits/second or bps, but it can also sometimes be expressed in cycles/second, or Hertz if the device is analog. If the Bandwidth on a server is higher, then the web page will be able to be delivered to more people at a faster rate, meaning that more customers will be serviced. Ergo, higher bandwidth may cost more but will mean for that more "hits" are generated.

#### Number Of Hits
A common misconception of Web Hits is that each hit is a visit, but this is not the case. Web Hits are the amount of files downloaded on your website. This includes images, graphics, videos and audio. If a website has many buttons and each one is an image, then they will get more hits. On average, a good website will get about 15 hits per view.

#### File Types
File Types, or File Formats, are a standardized attempt to store information and allow it to be read by specific programs. For example, `.exe` files can only be run on Windows systems, `.app` files can only be run on OSX systems and `.sh` files can only be run on Linux systems. This is because all Operating Systems are different under the hood, and each one performs actions differently. In the example of webiste development, `.html` files are Hyper Text Markup Language files and are used to display web pages on the internet. HTML files can contain HTML, JavaScript, PHP and others natively, but they can also import code from other files such as `.js` and `.php` files. HTML files can also use Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, files to stylise the website. Breaking up your website and storing commonly reused code means that it only has to be written once and it can then be imported again and again.
