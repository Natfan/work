### Internet Service Provider

An Internet Service Provider is a company that provides access to the internet to their customers. This is done by selling equipment to their customers. This equipment can be hardware such as routers and cabling, or software such as localhost webserver access to control the hardware remotely. Internet Service Providers have many different types of customers, including private citizens, small businesses and large corporations. Because all of these different groups have different needs, mulitple packages must be issued. For instance, a private individual will not need the same internet speeds and bandwidth as a datacenter, meaning that they will not expect to pay the same price. As a result, the structure of the hardware and software that the Internet Service Provider leased must be flexible to accomodate all these different needs.

### Web Hosting Services

A Web Hosting Service is a company that sells access to web servers in order to allow their clients access to publish websites on the World Wide Web. Web Hosting Services traditionally only sell access to small parts of dedicated servers, along with access to a web panel for file access and updating contact details and the like. Most Web Hosts will also give access to FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, as external programs are normally better than in-house, online file transferance tools due to their extended capabilites.

### Domain Structure

A Domain Structure is mainly constituted of Top-Level Domains, or TLDs, which are used to allow the user access to the website. Common TLDs are `.com`, `.net` and `.org`, but other domain level types exist. An example of this are country-code top level domains, such as `.uk`, `.de`, `.fr` and `.us`. There is also Second-Level domains, which are normally used to designate a region in a country. The main use of this is official state sites in America. The default CCLD in the United States is `.us`, but if the state of Ohio requires offical websites then they will use `<website>.oh.us`, to prove it's legitimacy.

### Domain Name Registrar

A Domain Name Registrar is a company that sells access to domain names. Domain Name Registrars are allowed to request that new domain names are made and, for the right price, can have exclusive access to them. An example of this is when Google, the search engine and software giant, purchased the rights to the `.app` domain for $25M. Other custom domain names which have been requested and subsequently purchased by companies, rather than ICANN generating them and then giving everyone access, include: `.axa`, `.cisco`, `.htc` and `.windows`. All of these domains can only be used by the companies that own them, or any persons or businesses that are allowed access.

### World Wide Web

The World Wide Web is a series of internet servers that allow users to access different documents and files. Users may navigate the World Wide Web via hyperlinks. The World Wide Web should not be confused with the **Internet**. The World Wide Web is the framework or structure of the Internet. The World Wide Web is only one part of the Internet, and other protocols such as `FTP` and `SMTP` use the Internet but are not classified as the World Wide Web. 

### Internet

The Web, or the Internet, is different from the World Wide Web in that it is a "network of networks". The Internet is formed of many protocols, including `WWW`, `FTP`, `SSH`, `SMTP` and more.
