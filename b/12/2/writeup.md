## PII: Impacts of Organisational Policies and Procedures on Technical Support
There are a few different policies and procedures that can hinder technical support and I shall list some of them, explain what they do and why they will impact the Technical Support services for this company.

### Service Level Agreements
Service Level Agreements, or SLA, are a method of ensuring that uptime is maintained by promising to users that if a certain percentage of uptime is not met, certain items that they purchase from the company will be complementary. For example, if an Internet Service Provider promises a 99% uptime, but due to faults on their end, the customer only gets 98% uptime and the ISP is definitely at fault then the user may be rewarded with a free week of Internet, or two times the amount of Internet upload and download speeds may be issued as an apology for breaking the agreement. This is an issue for the Technical Support team as they need to work on the system with minimal downtime to ensure that the SLA is not broken.

### Reporting Faults
If there is a fault that is not reported to the IT team then this fault may also be on other machines as well, meaning that the IT team has to spend more time fixing all of them rather than just working on one fix for the system and then rolling the fix out to all devices on the network. Also, if the fault is reported early on, then the fix can be rolled out before the fault affects any other systems. This means that there will be less downtime and thus work will be more productive.

### Security
There are a few different types of security that employees should implement when working at the company due to the fact that they allow the users to be more secure. The obvious security feature that everyone should have is a password as it allows users to ensure that their workstation is secure. Users can add to this level of security if the user adds an RFID tag to their keys so that they can quickly and easily without comprising the security benefits of having a long, alphanumeric password. Finally, users with laptops should enable some level of physical security by tying their laptop to the desk using their Kensington Lock slot.

The following is an email that I sent to my colleague Daniel Easteal about the types of faults that can occur in our businesses.
