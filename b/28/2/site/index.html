      <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid teal" class="w3-round">
      <p>The history of Redruth is a long and interesting one. Originally, it was a small market town that was mostly ignored due to it's larger
    neighbors. Once there was a boom in the ore industry at the start of the industrial revolution, everything changed. The copper ore that was found all over
    Redruth was suddenly vauable, and the population and wealth of the area exploded with the new found popular resources that seemed to be everywhere. Wealthy
    businessmen set up mines around Redruth in order to mine the copper to feed the machines of the industrial revolution, and the population of Redruth benefitted
    greatly from this. Previous mines were also used from previous business ventures from back when Redruth and the surrounding area was used for tin mining
    businesses. The high need for copper was driven by the large quantities of brass that had to be manufactured, the key component of which is copper. While the
    buninessmen who owned the mines became rich and successful, the miners and their families remain poor, ironically.
      </p>

      <p>During this time, the town started to develop itself around the mining industry. In 1882 a <em>School of Mines</em> was created to help
    educate a new generation of miners. Another key mining feature that was added during the late 1800 was the <em>Mining Exchange</em>, which was used to trade
    mineral stocks. The industrial revolution that helped reboot the mining industry was helping the town have a new lease of life. Sadly this didn't last long,
    and by the end of the 19th century, the mining industry had moved away from the Cornwall area due to a decline in resources, plunging the town into a
    spiraling into a depression as there was lots of mining equipment that was no longer being used. Also, due to the fact that all of the current population were
    either in the mining business or were being trained to work in the mines, they were now in redundent positions in jobs that were no longer availible. Because
    of this, many people emigrated to other countries that were more mining speicalised, such as the Americas, Austalasia and South Africa. The final operational
    mine near Redruth was also the last to be closed in all of Cornwall. The South Crofty mine in Pool closed in the first few months of 1998, effectively ending
    an era.
