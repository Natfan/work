# Unit XXIX Assignment I: Installing and Upgrading Software

*By Nathan Windisch*

## PI: Issues That Force Upgrades

### Security Issues

One issue that forces UTC Reading to update it's software and hardware is that
the software and hardware can be outdated, causing the needed for an upgrade to
occur. If the software is outdated, then security issues may be
created, resulting in accounts possibly being breached and data being stolen. An
example of this is when a bug was found in Yammer, the school's social
networking platform, that allowed any user to disable any other user's account
with ease.

### Data Loss

Another issue with this hardware being outdated is that data may be lost due to
hardware failure, such as a hard disk drive failing and losing all work that was
not backed up. This is why backing up data is highly recommended as it reduces
the risk of data being lost and it also allows the data to be accessed from
multiple systems across the world quickly and easily, if the data is backed up
online in the cloud. An example of this in UTC Reading is OneDrive, a way that
both the students and teachers back up and share documents and files.

### Increasing Efficiency

Yet another reason why the system may need an update is because it may be
beneficial to the users of the system, resulting in faster worktimes and a
better workplace efficiency. An example of this is removing old code that is
unused, and also revoking certain features that are no longer used or were never
even used in the first place. An example of this is removing TurnItIn, a system
that was used in UTC Reading to help give teachers BTEC assignments, but it was
abandoned in favor of giving in paper copies of the work.

### Increasing Functionality

Increasing functionality is also a reason as to why the system may need to be
updated. One example of this is that a new feature that has recently arisen as
being crucial to the way the business runs, in the case of UTC Reading this
could be an new development environment such as IntelliJ, a tool that is used
to program Java and is what the Android developer studio is loosely based on.

### Easier Usage of the System

Another reason as to why software or hardware should be updated is because it
allows users to have easier access to the system via making the controls and
usage of the system easier. An example of this is Yammer, which has slowly
gotten easier to use as time has gone on due to the way that it is constantly
updated and improved in the background.

### Installing Other New Hardware or Software

Also, new hardware or software may be needed to be installed in order for other
hardware or software to be installed, resulting in a chain of events that must
be followed in order to complete the intended outcome. This may take some time
and effort, but the end result will be worth while.

### Easier Access for External Users

External users who use the front end of the system such as clients of the
business may need an upgrade to the software so that it is easier to use,
similar to that of the employees who use the back end of the system.

### Faster Access for External Users

External users who use the front end of the system will want to access it as
fast as possible. This means that the hardware that runs the back end may need
to be updated.

### Bug Fixes for External Users

If there are any bug that external users come across on the front end, they will
need to be fixed in a timely manner, resulting in a better user experience and
better user retention.

### Company Policy

Company Policy may change, resulting in security to be increased or changes in
legal documentation and the way that the system reflects that. One policy that
may changes is the security level of the passwords, resulting in more numbers,
letters, upper/lower case and special characters to be used. Passwords may be
stored in a different way, such as hashing the passwords instead of storing them
in plain text, resulting in all passwords being needed to be changed.

## PII: Risks That Can Occur
If downtime occurs then the service that we provide could be temporarily lost,
resulting in a loss of profits due to users not being able to access our
services. It will also result in a lack of work being done as the system that
the workers normally use to complete tasks will be down.

Another risk that can occur is incompatibility with the current software or
hardware on the system. If this fault is not detected when the patches are
rolled out to only a few computers to test, then the whole network may be
unusable until the changes can be rolled back.

One way that these issues can be fixed is if all of the files on the system are
backed up before any changes are made, resulting in no data being lost if any
unexpected issues occur. This will save both time and money as no data will
need to be recreated, wasting valuable time.

Another way that these risks can be reduced is if the upgrades are performed at
a time that is considered low risk, meaning that it is a time when not many
people are using the system but the IT team can access the system and fix any
issues that may occur. A good time for this is during the evening or night time,
when all of the office workers have gone home. This will mean that these people
who are working throughout the night will need to be paid overtime, resulting in
more money being spent but a lower chances of the business losing profits during
peak traffic times. Another time that could be good for the fixes to be applied
is the weekend. This is actually better as the IT team will be more awake and
better prepared to fix any issues. It will probably be cheaper to pay the
workers over time, as they will likely demand less as it is during the day.

Yet another thing that can be used to reduce the risks of the upgrade is having
rollbacks available for use if anything goes drastically wrong. This can be
related to backing up files as the process is similar.

A final way that this process can have the risks lowered is by installing the
updates to the system slowly, to lower the risk of all of the system being
compromised.

## MI: Advantages and Disadvantages of Installing and Upgrading Software

### Installation Advantage \#1
One advantage to installing new software is that functionality will be improved
due to the fact that upgraded software will likely have more features that are
more useful and pertain better to the task at hand.

### Installation Advantage \#2
Another advantage to installing new software is that the User Interface could be
easier on the eye, along with being easier to use. This means that the business
will save time as well as money.

### Upgrade Advantage \#1
An advantage to upgrading software is that the software is faster than previous
iterations then the employees will be able to complete tasks faster.

### Upgrade Advantage \#2
Another advantage to upgrading new software is that it may be cheaper in the
long run. If this version is better than the previous version, then it is
probably more efficient and will save the business time, and therefore money.

### Installation Disadvantage \#1
One disadvantage to installing new software is that the employees
will not know how to use the new software, resulting in more money being spent
on training your employees. More money is also wasted as these employees will
not be during their jobs during this time of training.

### Installation Disadvantage \#2
Another disadvantage to the new software being installed is the cost. New software can cost
a lot of money, especially if it is bespoke or professional software as there is
a lack of demand for it so the prices are higher than they normally should be.
This means that the business will lose money in the short term as they have to
purchase a license for this new piece of software.

### Upgrade Disadvantage \#1
One issue with upgrading the software on the system is that certain aspects of
the system may have changed. Similar to Installation Disadvantage \#1, this could
mean that training is required, being a money drain in two ways as it costs
money to train the employees and it also loses money as these employees are not
working.

### Upgrade Disadvantage \#2
Another issue with upgrading the system is that the new software may not be very
reliable. If the software that is installed is a beta branch of the code, or if
is new and has not been tested much, then bugs are more than likely to occur.
This means that there will be a loss of money as the employees don't have
anything to do until the bugs are fixed.

## MII: Application Install Process

### Application That Will Be Installed
I choose to install Google Chrome as the application to install on a fresh
machine. The first process that can be used is simple and is as follows: Log
into the system as an Administrator. Open up Microsoft Edge or Internet
Explorer and go to http://google.com/chrome/browser. Click on the **Download
Chrome** button, then press **Agree and Install** after reading through the
legal documentation and Terms of Service. Launch **ChromeSetup.exe** and allow
it access to modify the system. Follow the instructions on screen. You have
successfully installed Google Chrome.

### Requirements
One of the main requirements of Google Chrome is that it has lots of Random
Access Memory, or RAM, at it's disposal. Contrary to popular belief, Google
Chrome is not actually a massive RAM user. It merely takes the RAM for use
later, and if it sees another system process that needs the RAM it stops storing
it. This means that the RAM is used efficiently at all times. Google Chrome
requires at least Windows 7 and a Intel Pentium 4 processor, or later, that is
capable of SSE2, if you are running Windows. If you are running Mac you need at
least OSX Mavericks 10.9 and if you are running Linux you need a 64bit version
of Ubunutu 14.04 or later, Debian 8 or later, openSUSE 13.1 or later, or Fedora
21 or later, and a Intel Pentium 4 processor or later with SSE2 capabilities.

The requirements for upgrading the software are similar to that of installing
it. No more system specifications are required for an upgrade to Google Chrome,
as it does not require much more processing power.

### Sequence of Activities
The sequence of activities when installing software should be as follows: The
software should be checked for compatibility with the current system. Any
compatibility issues should be attempted to be resolved. If these issues cannot
be resolved, a new software should be sought out. The software should then be
purchased for the correct price by the official seller of the product. If there
is a license for non-commercial use which is free, it should not be used if it
going to be used within a commercial setting, as that is both unethical and also
illegal and could result in a lawsuit. Also, if there is a license for 10 people
to use the software and you have 11 people who will use the system, the next
tier of license should be purchased. The software should be then either burnt
onto a installation disk if there are individual computers being used, or it
should be placed onto the central server if thin clients or "dumb terminals" are
being used. The software should not yet be installed. After this we are going
back up files on the system that we are installing the software on, to prevent
data loss. The system that we are installing on should be similar to a typical
system that can be found within the business, to simulate the software being
rolled out all across the business. This test system should then be used
extensively to find any and all bugs that could be generated. These bug should
then be quashed. Once you are sure that there are no issues you should roll out
the new changes to the entire system. This should be done at a time that is
convenient to all users, and I shall touch on this later.

### Materials
The list of materials that you will need is rather short, but I shall list them
anyway. The software with either written permission from the developer that you
are allowed to use it or the correct licensing for the software. A beta client
that you can test the software on, it should be very similar to the systems that
you will be installing the software on later.

### Timings
The timings of this system upgrade is crucial to keeping a good workplace
efficiency. If the software is installed during peak times, it will disrupt the
workflow of the people in the office, resulting in a decrease in profits from
the company. For this reason timings should be set either during the nights or
on weekends, and should have notifications sent to the IT staff if an issue
arises.

### Communications: Users
Communication between Users and the IT support team is crucial. Users should be
warned that updates are going to occur so that they can backup their data and
prepare for the update before hand. Users must be aware of the possible downtime
and effects of the changes as well.

### Communication: Management
Communication between Management and the IT team is crucial as it allows the
managers to know what is happening and when it is happening. This is important
as the managers should be aware of all changes to the way that the system works
due to the fact that they need to be able to tell their employees what to do to
and when to do it. This is crucial to the work of the business as it means that
there will be a more useful use of time and resources.

### Communication: Software Vendors
Communication between the IT team and the Software Vendors is crucial to the
business keeping up to date on all of the latest software changes to the system.
This also allows the business to possibly request new features in the software,
if they are on good relations with the Software Vendors and Developers of the
original product. This means that they can either get new features added or have
bugs fixed quicker. This will result in the software being more bespoke than
before, as new features will be added specifically for the business to improve
their systems and make them more efficient and unique.

### Back Out Process
A back out process should be initiated into the system to allow for the process
to be abandoned if severe issues such as data loss or incompatibilities occur.
If the back out process has to be used then it should not affect any other parts
of the system, and should return all data to it's previous state before the
upgrades occurred. No data should be lost during this process. If data is lost
within the main system then protocols should be put in place to both access the
latest copy of the files from an offsite backup, and the measures should be
taken to prevent the system from losing data again.

### Gaining Permission & Access
Permission to use the software that is being installed on the system in the
manner that it is should be gained, either from the software developers or the
software vendors. All licenses should be followed to the letter and should all
be fully documented in case of a possible law suit or other legal trouble, to
keep the business' reputation high and to allow for any legal processes to be
smooth and painless. Access to the system should also be authorized by those
high up within the company's hierarchy. If this access is not gained and the
systems are upgraded anyway, any issues that arise will be solely on the hands
of the technicians who performed the maintenance, and none on the managers as
they did not authorized the upgrade.

### Contractual Requirements
There are a few contractual requirements that are needed to perform this
software installation. One thing that should be required is the promise to not
install the software on any system that has not been authorized by the legal
license that has been purchased for the software. This means that the software
is only used for it's intended purpose and the contract between the software
vendor and the users of the software is not broken.

Another contractual requirement is that any source code that is given to the
company must not be shared with anyone outside of the company, as that is not
part of the terms of service.

Also, all terms and conditions must be fully read before agreed to, to prevent
any possible legal complications if these terms and conditions are not followed
and then the vendor is wrongly sued, resulting in lost profits from the
business as they have to spend money on a lawyer or lawyers that cannot win the
suit.

### Resource Allocations
Resource allocations are important as it allows the IT team to know how many
resources they can use.

## DII: Minimizing Risks

There are a few different ways of minimizing risks, one of which being backups.
There are many different types of backup types, such as a full backup, where ALL
of the data specified is backed up to the external servers. This type of backup
may only be performed once every few months.

Another type of data backup is
differential, where only the data that has been changed since the last backup
occurs is stored elsewhere. This type of backup should be done once every few
weeks or so. An example of this is as follows:

* A full backup is performed on Day \#1.
* A differential backup is performed on Days \#2 and \#3.

All of these backups will contain the data that has changed from Day \#1,
meaning that Day \#2 will only contain Day \#2's work, where as Day \#3 will
have Day \#2 and Day \#3’s work. This means that differential backups can take
up lots of space very quickly, which is why it shouldn’t be done all the time.

The final type of backup that I shall be covering is incremental, where only the
data that has changed since the last incremental backup occurs is stored
elsewhere. This type of backup should be performed daily or every other day. An
example of this is as follows:

* A full backup is performed on Day \#1.
* An incremental backup is performed on Days \#2 and \#3.

All of these backups will contain the data that has changed from Day \#x-1,
meaning that Day \#2 will only contain Day \#2’s work, and Day \#3 will have
only have Day \#3’s work.

These backup plans can be deployed by transferring all of the data on the offsite
storage over to the main site. Another method is using the offsite data centers
as a temporary base of operations.

Another of which is choosing a low traffic time to install the upgrades. This
can be achieved by making a graph of when the least amount of users are on the
system by collecting the data over a few weeks, and the perform the maintenance
when there is the least amount of users on, meaning that a relatively small amount
of users will be affected by the downtime. Always attempt to notify the users before
hand and attempt to give them a monetary compensation for any downtime that is
not covered in the service level agreement, or SLA. Many server hosts and other
ISPs promise a 99.9% uptime, and if that uptime is not met then credit is added
to the account. While this may not be needed for UTCReading as no students are
paid, this may be useful for teachers and other staff as they will not be able to
complete their work on time or to a decent standard.

Yet another way of minimizing risk is by performing incremental installations. This
means that all the systems that need to be updated on the network get updated at
different times. The main result of this is that any issues that occur with the
software that is sent out to the small amount of system is confined to that small
amount of system, resulting in less users having downtime on their computers. This
in turn results in more excelent results for the students as they can complete all
of their work before deadlines. Another reason for incremental installations is that
it allows for bugs that are found during the first few waves of the installations to
be quashed and for these bugs to not be sent to the later waves of the updates,
resutling in less work for the IT team, meaning that more time can be spent on more
pressing issues. A downside to this is that it can take more time than is nessessary,
resutling in less work actually being made overall.

Another way is by installing it on just one system and testing it for
incompatibility issues. While this may be time consuming and tedious, it may result
in less bugs and issues being found down the line, meaning that less time is spent on
the issue overall. The result of this could be that time is wasted on unimportant tasks,
but it also means that there is a secure and bug-free version of the software that is
on all systems. This method will take the longest out of all of the methods, but it is
probably the most effective,
