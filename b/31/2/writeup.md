# Unit XXXI Assignment II
*By Nathan Windisch*

## Task I
### PIV: Software Tools for Animation
There are four main tools that are used in making animation, and I will list all of them and explain what they do.

#### Frame
A frame is a still image within a video or animation. Every single video ever made has frames, and the standardized amount of frames per second, or `FPS`, in a feature movie is 24. This means that for every second in a movie, 24 still images are being played. Because this is moving so fast, the video looks like things are moving. The speed at which the frames are set at in the video is called the `framerate`. If you are filming a short animation and want the film to be longer, then you could lower the framerate to say, 5 FPS. This will mean that only 5 frames are shown per second, meaning that it will be 6 times faster than an animation shot at 30 FPS. The only issue with this is that 5 frames per second will be much more slow and *clunky*, meaning that it will look less realistic. A good balance is the amount of frames that makes the movie look fluid, but still keeping the movie at a reasonable length.

#### Layer
When creating an animation via a computer, you will not want to make many different objects all on the same group. For one, this will make it very unorganized and hard to work with, and for another it may mean that you delete the wrong thing by accident. This is where layers come in. Layers allow the user to separate different objects and other aspects of their project, meaning that it is easier to find different objects and edit singular parts of the animation. These layers can be locked so that they cannot be moved, hidden so that they are not distracting or placed in "solo mode" so that they be worked on individually.

#### Button
Buttons can be found in websites and applications that require a user's input. An example of this is a music player application that will have buttons that let the user play, pause, stop, rewind and fast-forward the currently playing song. These buttons are coincidentally also found within animation applications such as Flash and After Effects. These let you navigate your animation with ease, letting you go to very precise areas of your program.

#### Library
Libraries are like APIs within programming, they allow you to add new features and functionality to your animations. An example of this could be if you wish to add bouncing to your animation, you can just use `bounce.js`, a Javascript library that makes CSS have a more "warm, bouncy" feel to your shapes.

### PV: Factors when Creating Animations for the Web
There are a few different criteria that need to be considered when designing and creating animations for the web, and they are as follows:

* House Style
* Output Devices (PC, Mobile etc)
* Email Attachment
* Size

I shall now go more in-depth with each of these points.

#### House Style
The first point is house style, which is the generic style that the place that you place your animation on will have. An example of this is that if you have a website with a very dark and minimalist theme, making an animation that has a bright and sunny theme and message may not be the best idea. Another example would be if you made a animation with lots of bevels and edges on a website that was very flat and used a Material Design philosophy.

#### Output Devices
Output Devices are also very important. If you are creating an animation for a PC version of a website, bandwidth may not be an issue, as will be discussed later. A PC also means that the screen will be bigger and the pixel density may be lower due to the fact that the screen is larger but the resolution stays the same. A mobile will be smaller and more compact, this meaning that the animation size will need to be smaller.

#### Email Attachment & Size
When sending an animation via an email attachment, then the file size of the animation will need to be smaller. Compression may be required for this, but it may also lower the quality of the animation. Another reason why the file size may need to be smaller is if it is being accessed on a mobile, where data plans may limit the size of the image that the user wants to download.

### MIII: Techniques used to Minimize Animation File Size
There are a few different techniques that can be used to minimize the file size of animations. The following is a short list of a few techniques that can be used:

* Quality vs Quantity
 - Lossy Compression
 - Lossless Compression
* Auto Cropping
* Frame Disposal

I shall now explain what they are, as seen below:

#### Quality vs Quantity
One of the main ways to minimise a GIF's size is to reduce the quality of the image. This can be done by just lowering the resolution of the image, but other things can be done as I shall explain below. The important thing to remember is that you will need to balance the quality of the image with the quantity of the amount of images that you can save on your drive. This basically means that you could store one GIF that has an incredibly high resolution and framerate, but if it is 1TB in size then it will be very hard to save lots of them. The other side of the coin is that you could save an image as only eight pixels in width and height, but it would be very hard to make out what it is supposed to be, especially if the original source material is an image or series of images taken from real life. A way to solve this would be to use compression, a method to make files smaller. There are two categories of compression, lossy and lossless, and I shall elaborate on them now.

##### Lossy Compression


##### Lossless Compression


#### Auto Cropping


#### Frame Disposal


#### Colour Density
