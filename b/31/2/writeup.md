# Unit XXXI Assignment II
*By Nathan Windisch*

## Task I
### PIV: Software Tools for Animation
There are four main tools that are used in making animation, and I will list all of them and explain what they do.

#### Frame
A frame is a still image within a video or animation. Every single video ever made has frames, and the standardized amount of frames per second, or `FPS`, in a feature movie is 24. This means that for every second in a movie, 24 still images are being played. Because this is moving so fast, the video looks like things are moving. The speed at which the frames are set at in the video is called the `framerate`. If you are filming a short animation and want the film to be longer, then you could lower the framerate to say, 5 FPS. This will mean that only 5 frames are shown per second, meaning that it will be 6 times faster than an animation shot at 30 FPS. The only issue with this is that 5 frames per second will be much more slow and *clunky*, meaning that it will look less realistic. A good balance is the amount of frames that makes the movie look fluid, but still keeping the movie at a reasonable length.

#### Layer
When creating an animation via a computer, you will not want to make many different objects all on the same group. For one, this will make it very unorganized and hard to work with, and for another it may mean that you delete the wrong thing by accident. This is where layers come in. Layers allow the user to separate different objects and other aspects of their project, meaning that it is easier to find different objects and edit singular parts of the animation. These layers can be locked so that they cannot be moved, hidden so that they are not distracting or placed in "solo mode" so that they be worked on individually.

#### Button
Buttons can be found in websites and applications that require a user's input. An example of this is a music player application that will have buttons that let the user play, pause, stop, rewind and fast-forward the currently playing song. These buttons are coincidinally also found within animation applications such as Flash and After Effects. These let you navigate your animation with ease, letting you go to very precise areas of your program.
