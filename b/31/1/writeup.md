## PI: Different Types of Animation
There are a few different ways that animation can be used. This informational leaflet will list five different types of animation and why they are important.

### Traditional Animation
Traditional Animation covers all types of animation that are hand drawn by an animator. These animations have each individual frame drawn and are shot in sequence to create a moving picture. A good example of this is a flip book, or an old Disney movie.

### 2D Animation
2D Animations are vector based animations that have become increasingly popular within the last view years due to the rise of the ease of access of animation software. Adobe's Flash is cheap, especially the older versions that are not SaaS, meaning that they have a fixed cost rather than a monthly cost. Flash animations are also very quick and easy to make, meaning that they are an ideal starting point for beginner animators that want to learn tools and techniques of the trade without spending large amounts of time and money on purchasing and subsequently leaning how to use professional, expensive software. Many animation shows, such as South Park, are made using 2D animation softwares and techniques, rather than the traditional methods of doing so.

### 3D Animation
3D Animation is vastly different from the other forms of animation mentioned thus far. Rather than simply being able to draw well, 3D animators also need to be able to be good at computer animation. A more colloquial term for 3D animation is CGI, which stands for `Computer Generated Images`. These are used largely in movies and TV shows, where it would not be economically feasible to shoot a scene using practical effects.

### Motion Graphics
Motion Graphics are a method of moving text and shapes around a canvas. This method is primarily used for title cards and introductions to movies and videos. While typography, which is a type of motion graphic, can seem like it is very simple and easy to make, it can be very hard to make a motion graphic look fluid and easy on the eye. It takes a lot of artistic skill and effort to create decent animation.

The following example is part of a video which can be seen at [natfan.github.io/typography](https://natfan.github.io/typography)

### Stop Motion
Stop Motion is another older form of animation and uses singlar images that have only a few things moved to be placed one after the other, to make it seem like the subjects in question are moving. Stop motion has been used in popular culture, such as the TV show and movie `Wallace and Gromit`.
